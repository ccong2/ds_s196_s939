title: "Applied Data Science for Cities"
---

Urban science draws on statistics, visualization, and spatial analysis techniques to gain deeper insights into cities and actively contribute to their development. In this course, we'll dive into the dynamic world of urban science by learning how to tell stories about cities and neighborhoods, covering a range of topics including demographic analysis, health and transportation, and using R as our primary quantitative analysis and interactive visualization tool.
